        <p class="presume">My career goal is to become a computer programmer, I want a Bachelor's degree in computer programming. I attend Palm Desert High school located in Palm Desert. I have been attending Palm Desert High for three years, I am currently a junior. I
          am taking the computer science course at my school to expand my understanding on the languages. I am still uncertain about which college I would like to attend, however, I know my career goal. I have had minor work experience with programming,
          for instance, I used to develop plugins for servers on Minecraft: Pocket Edition which was my foundation as to where my interest and desire in programmer grew. It was a great experience for me, therefore, I had insisted that I would pursue it
          as a career.</p>
        <p class="presume"> I have numerous skills that I feel pertain to this career, for example, I am experienced with managing an entire staff team consisting of over 25 members, I have worked for other network owners as a moderator, and administrator. I am experienced
          in HTML, CSS, and PHP. I used PHP in most of the server development. For example, server cores, and plugin development. I also used PHP to send data collected from players on numerous servers to an SQL server to manage the information with ease.</p>
        <p class="presume"> I have received numerous academic achievements, the most recent ones I have gotten were Honor Rolls for having a 3.0 or higher GPA, I received these achievements in the years of 2016, and 2017. A hobby I am interested in right now is moderation.
          I am currently a moderator for the
