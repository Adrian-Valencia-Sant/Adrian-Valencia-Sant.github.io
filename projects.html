        <p>The development of my app consisted of a program called Thunkable, 
        which allowed me to drag and drop blocks of code, eventually leading 
        to the creation of my functional app. I developed my app by creating 
        buttons which had attached blocks of code so when the button is pressed, 
        an audio file is played, resulting in the stimulation of this character 
        consuming products with the audio included. In addition, I also added a 
        weight counter which calculates the weight of this character when he is 
        fed and when the fat button is pressed to forcefully increase the weight 
        of this character. I did this by creating a variable for clicks, which 
        registers the number of times the user has clicked the button to increase 
        the characters weight, as well as to add the sum total of the weight when 
        the button is clicked simultaneously. However, the development of this app 
        was not easy, during my development phase, I encountered multiple problems. 
        For example, when I created the clicks variable and tried to count the clicks 
        while adding the weight together in a math block, I had issues with printing 
        the integer total of the characters weight due to the weight getting set to zero 
        every click, instead of printing the digit, It would export the answer, “Not a number” 
        in the abbreviated form of "Nan". As a result, I created a separate function which 
        set the weight counter to zero when the game screen opened, which fixed the issue 
        of the weight counter. Furthermore, another problem I encountered was when the audio 
        file was played, it would not get sent if the user simultaneously clicked the button. 
        Consequently, I looped the audio strings so they would repeat even if the user was not 
        patient with feeding the man. In conclusion, these were the only incidents I 
        had which occurred in errors, and app crashes, however, I was able to get them fixed, 
        and this app was independent development as there were no collaborators in this project.</p>
