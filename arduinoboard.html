                    <p> The development of our Arduino board consisted of a program called Arduino, which allowed us to manually program the functionality of our board. We developed the board script by locating the ports specifically the ones being modified
                        with code, and added their functionality through our script which was uploaded to the Arduino board. We had an issue with the temperature display as it would not display the correct temperature. In addition, we also had issues
                        with the Arduino board as we had the wrong libraries installed which was causing it to crash. However, we installed the proper libraries and eventually were able to get the temperature display to work with the right libraries and
                        code. Nonetheless, it was a blast to work on this collaborative project with my partner, Gabe. We successfully managed to create a functional temperature checker with our Arduino Board and overcame many obstacles while working
                        with this form of programming.</p>
