        <p> My career goal is to become a programmer and work for big industries that pay well. I have initialized my plan this year by taking the computer science course this year at my school to enhance and expand my range of understand when it comes to
          languages within the coding industry. Moreover, I have been contemplating my decisions for years when it comes to a career, and when I got into coding it became an addicition. Overtime, I knew this was the career for me, I want to advance with
          technology as it evolves, not stay in the loop of medieval times. Therefore, after reviewing salaries and comparing laborious job wages with wages of programming I was blown away and my decision was clear. Not only do I see my future career
          as a hobby that will bring in income, it is also my form of entertainment as I am a persistent learner.</p>
        <p> Throughout my short time of programming and learning the arts of computer science I have improved my skills and knowledgement within this field. I contain numerous qualities influenced by my parents and my culture, I firmly believe my parents
          have pushed me to become the persistent, hard-working, and determined individual that I am today. I have many morals that have built my character and I am content with these morals because without them I would not have gotten into programming
          and pursuing a life changing career.</p>
        <p> I have had numerous accomplishments throughout my journey with programming. For example, when I was 14 I founded and managed an entire network of servers for players on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and had hundreds of online players with over 20
          live servers. I hosted for approximately 9 months and profited in revenue monthly. However, I shut down the network due to lack of time with school starting, and a decline in players as competition became fierce, and new games were released
          such as Fortnite.</p>
